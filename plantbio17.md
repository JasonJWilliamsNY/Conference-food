## F.A.Q.

- **What is "as is/at your own risk"?**: I can't guarantee this place will be open when you get there,
that you will like the food, or that the scene won't be shady.
- **What is "Invite Jason"?**: Jason wishes he could accept every invitation, but he is a busy guy; the demands on his time are formidable. Nevertheless, if you see a yes, you can always ask.
- **Why so far, any other places?**: There are lots of other places on Oahu worth visiting and you can get nearly anywhere in an hour (presuming you are not stuck on H1). Tried to limit to places you can get to walking, or by [TheBus](http://www.thebus.org/). I have other places but frankly, I'm still jet lagged and also don't want to give away all my secrets. Hopefully others will add!
