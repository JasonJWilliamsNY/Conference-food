## F.A.Q.

- **What is "as is/at your own risk"?**: I can't guarantee this place will be open when you get there,
that you will like the food, or that the scene won't be shady.
- **What is "Invite Jason"?**: Jason wishes he could accept every invitation, but he is a busy guy; the demands on his time are formidable. Nevertheless, if you see a yes, you can always ask.
